#Simplify Darkish for Firefox

Author: dpcdpc11.deviantart.com
Use it with my Simplify 10 Darkish - Windows 10 Theme: https://gumroad.com/dpcdpc11

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

- starting with Firefox 69, loading of userChrome.css is disabled by default. So to enable it back again load about:config in the Firefox address bar, then search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and set it to True by double clicking the "Value" column.
- now go to your profile folder. You can do it like this: load about:support in your Firefox addressbar and click on the "Open Folder" button next to "Profile Folder" label.
- if no "chrome" folder exists there, please create one.
- now copy the included userChrome.css and userContent.css files to that "chrome" folder.
- make sure you use the Default Firefox theme.
- restart Firefox and enjoy!
